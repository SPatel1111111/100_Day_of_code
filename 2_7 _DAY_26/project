If you're not familiar with React or Vue.js and prefer to stick with technologies you're comfortable with, you can still build a robust virtual study group application using simpler frontend technologies. Hereâ€™s an updated implementation stack that avoids using modern JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js:

### Frontend
1. **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling your web pages. Use semantic HTML for better accessibility.
2. **JavaScript**: Use vanilla JavaScript for interactivity. You can also use jQuery for easier DOM manipulation and AJAX calls if you prefer.
3. **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and pre-built UI components, which will help you create a visually appealing layout without extensive CSS knowledge.
4. **Video Conferencing**:
   - **WebRTC**: For peer-to-peer video communication if you want to implement it yourself.
   - **Third-Party API**: Consider using **Twilio Video**, **Zoom API**, or **Jitsi Meet** for easier integration and additional features.

### Backend
1. **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the application.
2. **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: For ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the database.
3. **Flask-Migrate**: For handling database migrations.
4. **Flask-Login**: For user authentication and session management.
5. **Flask-SocketIO**: For real-time communication (e.g., chat features, signaling for WebRTC).
6. **File Uploads**: Use **Flask-Uploads** or **Flask-Dropzone** for handling file uploads.

### Database
1. **SQLite**: For development due to its simplicity.
2. **PostgreSQL**: For production, as it offers better scalability and performance.

### Real-time Features
- **Flask-SocketIO**: To enable real-time features like chat and signaling for video calls.

### Deployment
1. **Heroku**: For easy deployment and scaling, especially if you're just starting out.
2. **DigitalOcean**: For more control over the server environment, especially if you expect higher traffic.
3. **Docker (Optional)**: To containerize your application, making it easier to manage dependencies and deploy consistently across environments.

### Version Control
- **Git**: For version control to track changes in your codebase and collaborate with others.

### Testing
- **pytest**: A testing framework for Python to write unit tests and ensure code reliability.

### Documentation
- **Markdown** or **Sphinx**: For documenting your code and providing user guides.

### Example Implementation Stack Summary
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS, JavaScript (vanilla or jQuery), Bootstrap, WebRTC or a third-party video API.
- **Backend**: Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, Flask-Login, Flask-SocketIO.
- **Database**: SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production).
- **Deployment**: Heroku or DigitalOcean, with optional Docker for containerization.
- **Version Control**: Git.
- **Testing**: pytest.
- **Documentation**: Markdown or Sphinx.

This stack allows you to build your virtual study group application without the need for modern JavaScript frameworks, while still providing the necessary features for user interaction, collaboration, and real-time communication. You can focus on using technologies you are comfortable with, ensuring a smoother development process.
